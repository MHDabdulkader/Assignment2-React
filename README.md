This project provides a dynamic filtering mechanism for products based on collections and size. It automatically updates when the database changes, allowing new options to be added seamlessly.

## Features:

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Options for both collections and sizes are dynamically handled, ensuring that any updates to the database are reflected in the dropdown menus.
- **Real-time Filter:** Selecting a collection or size updates the displayed items in real time.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI adjusts to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop.

## Option for Collection:
The available collection options are dynamically generated based on the product data.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
